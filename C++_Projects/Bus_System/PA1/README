I have sought help from the following people:	Huang, Ya (student ID: 20206959)
I have read the following books:
I have consulted the following websites: Cplusplus.com, stackoverflow.com(some posts)
(if the addresses are required, please reply me by email)

The work included in this program is all my own work (Y/N): N


/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain your overall approach and the unique features of your program
 **********************************************************************/
This program is bus route system which can assign information from some
 .txt files and create a bus route with a given route number,
and a pointer, start, pointing to linked objects, the stop_node. 
This program is able to print out the information of bus route and stop nodes,
calculate the direct and path distance between first and last nodes, 
insert new stop node with the shortest distances to previous and next nodes.
It also have the delete nodes function, and it can reverse the order between
 2 given stop nodes or reverse the order of the whole list.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems your program has, or anything which
 *  you have not implemented successfully
 **********************************************************************/
The most serious problem is the reverse function is too difficult to complete.

 **********************************************************************/
To more familiar with the applications of pointers, like doubly linked list.
To study how to fix the bug and how to solve the bugs.
To understand how to open file and assign information to an object.

I like the assignment as it is a good tool and method to let me understand 
how to use my knowlegde and how to exert it in the assignment.
